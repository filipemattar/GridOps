GridOps - Brazil

The main goal of the app is to share real time information about Brazil's energy matrix and it's behaviour during the day. 

Also the nexts steps of the development is aiming to train a timeseries model to predict the generation for the next day. Fo this I am setting an Apache Airflow to create an ETL and retrieve data from db and retrain the model on a daily basis seeking performance and accuracy improvements as the db grows.

Updates coming...
